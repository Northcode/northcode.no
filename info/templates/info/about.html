### About Northcode

We are a small programming and software group situated in norway and switzerland.
We do mostly programming in c#, python and web.

Our original projects were this website and a version manager for Minecraft.
One of our biggest projects to date is [cobalt vault](https://cobaltvault.no),
which is a user content sharing site for the game [cobalt](http://playcobalt.com).

### Andreas
#### What I do:
* Web development on [northcode.no](https://northcode.no)
* Making hobby projects in various languages such as [a python podcatcher](https://github.com/Northcode/pypodder), you can find most of them on my [github](https://github.com/Northcode)
* Making websites for people and organisations, such as [eskelan.com](http://eskelan.com)
* Linux server maintenance
* Currently teaching python programming at a local high school

#### My education
Most of my knowledge about all things computing is self taught from the internet, as the schools I've gone to have had no computer or programming courses.
I am now (2016) attending first year of university at a bachelors degree in computer engineering at [The Arctic University of Norway, campus Narvik](https://en.uit.no/).  
Most of my skills currently are as follows:  

* 6 years experience in c# programming, dealing mostly with native .net framework and mono.  
* 5 years of html,css and php programming. I prefer writing pages in python now however  
* A few years on and off with c++  
* About 3 months of django experience  
* 3-4 years of Linux experience, running servers and workstations, in Ubuntu Linux and Arch Linux  

#### Misc random stuff about me
As a resident of the frozen wastes of Norway, I enjoy skiing and snowboarding, both cross country and down-hill, as well as hiking in the summer.  
I've grown to love tea a lot, and can often be seen either drinking or making tea.  
I play piano whenever I feel like it, I didn't say I was any good, but I like it.  
My favourite band is Coldplay, but I listen to most things from Metal to Hip Hop, [follow me on soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/andreas-larsen-14) to see more of what I like.
