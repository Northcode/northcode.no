					<h2>Northcode</h2>
					<p>Northcode is currently a team of two people, the cousins Andreas Larsen and Jens Vogler. We started out teaching programming our selves and then started making projects togheter. The kickstart to the cooperative work was the Minecraft server which we both maintained and then later the MC-Manger Application which we worked on togheter.</p>
					<p>From there on we continued with our projects. Sometimes togheter and at other times we worked individually on stuff. But our bond persisted, which is still strong based on family and mutual interest.</p>
